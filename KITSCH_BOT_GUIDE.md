## 🎨 Building the Perfect Embed

The `/embed create` command takes you through a streamlined, multi-step process:

### Step 1: Content & Structure
Choose a channel and whether to "Post Now" or "Schedule for Later". A modal will appear where you can enter:
- **Title**: The bold heading of your embed.
- **Description**: The main body text (supports standard Discord Markdown).
- **Author**: Adds a small author name at the top.
- **Footer**: Adds text at the very bottom.

### Step 2: Visual Style (Color)
Select a color from the dropdown. 
> [!TIP]
> **Kitsch Pink** (`#FF69B4`) is the bot's signature color for a premium look!

### Step 3: Images & Media
You can add two types of images via URLs:
- **Thumbnail**: A small image in the top-right corner.
- **Banner Image**: A large image at the bottom of the embed.

### Step 4: Interactive Buttons
You can add up to **25 buttons** (5 rows of 5). 
- **Link Buttons**: Enter a Label and a URL (e.g., `https://google.com`).
- **Interactive Buttons**: Leave the URL field empty to create a button that users can click (currently displays a "Button Clicked!" message).

## 📅 Scheduling Posts

If you choose the "Schedule" option, you will be prompted for:
1. **Date**: Format `YYYY-MM-DD` (e.g., `2024-12-25`)
2. **Time**: Format `HH:MM AM/PM` (e.g., `09:00 PM`)

The bot will handle the rest and post it exactly at that time!

## 📝 Formatting & Best Practices

- **Bold**: `**text**`
- **Italics**: `*text*`
- **Links**: `[Display Text](https://url.com)`
- **Lists**: Use `-` or `•` at the start of lines.
- **Emojis**: Use standard Discord emojis or custom server emoji syntax `<:name:id>`.
